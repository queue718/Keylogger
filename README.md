This Keylogger captures screenshots, audio, text, and system info. It uses threading to listen for audio, text, screenshots, and clipboards at the same time. It then (is supposed to) upload and email the documents to a pre-specified email address.

Make sure to have a folder labeled "captures" with subfiles named "key_log.txt", "systeminfo.txt" and subfolders named "audios" and "screenshots" in the same directory as the program is running in.
